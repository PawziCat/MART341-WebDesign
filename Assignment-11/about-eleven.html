                     I was struck by the simplicity and profundity of what the Dalai Lama was saying. This was far from "don’t
                    worry, be happy," as the popular Bobby McFerrin song says. This was not a denial of pain and suffering, but
                     a shift in perspective -- from oneself and toward others, from anguish to compassion -- seeing that others
                    are suffering as well. The remarkable thing about what the Dalai Lama was describing is that as we recognize
                    others’ suffering and realize that we are not alone, our pain is lessened.
