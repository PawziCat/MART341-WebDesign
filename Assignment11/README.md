## Assignment 11

 
### Page
I am working on my online portfolio for my graphic design business I focused on my About page.


### Required Techniques (Must Have):
#### External Style Sheets:
* I used two seperate external style sheets, one for my styles and the other specifically for my fonts. I started out with only sans-serif fonts but ended up moving towards monospace as it reads better.


#### Hover Effect:
* I used hover to make my navigation bar links turn blue and become underlined when hovered over.


#### Self-hosted Library **AND** Font from a Library
* I am not 100% sure that I did these right? I used three fonts:
  - Retrolight (downloaded from Dafont. It is placed in the font folder and linkd to the font style sheet.)
  - poppins (downloaded from google fonts. It is placed in the font folder and linked to the font style sheet.)
  - Sans-serif (chosen for my alt due to being a supported font.)  


#### Additional Techniques:
* I experiemented with different type faces.
* Adjust font-weight for emphasis
* Use text-decoration to add a hover effect that caused the navigation links to chage blue and become underlined.
* Adjust the line-heightspacing to improve readability.
* Align text or elements to better control the flow of my site's content.
* I used pseudo-classes to style my links and navigation bar.
