## Assignment 12

 
### Page
I am working on my online portfolio for my graphic design business I focused on all my pages as they are styled with the same sheet, I was primarily focused on my gallery page however.


### 6 Techniques
#### Size:
* I used size to control the width of elements like the navigation bar and banner images/videos to be 100% of the window/screen. 
* I also used it to control the width of the columns on my pages.


#### Over Flow:
* I used overflow to control the way that my about page displays text on narrower screens to look better and maintain page flow


#### Border
* I used borders on the top and bottem of my navigation bar to seperate it from the background of my page.  


#### Margin:
* I used margins to put space between my content and the sides of the screen
* to break up elements like the column aranged boxes.


#### Padding:
* I used padding to position my text and images withing the boxes to keep them centered and from crowding the edges.


#### Position:
* I used position to make my navigation bare stick to the top of he window/screen when you scroll down the page.


#### Additional Techniques:
I for the life of me cannot get the dropdown menu to work with my navigation bar. I will likely try to figure this out next week when I can recode and style things.
