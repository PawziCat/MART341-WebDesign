## Assignment 4 Questions
1. Explain how web browsers function. How do web browsers really work behind the scenes?
Web browsers is a software program that allows the user to access the internet. Web browsers take the instructions provided by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display visual representations of texts, graphics and other kinds of content in the intended layouts. It directs the interactions between the user interface and the rendering engine, communicating over the network to request all the necessary files that make up a web page.

2. What is the DOM (Document Object Model), and how does it power your web pages? 
DOM is a content tree and provides a object representation of the HTML document. It powers web pages by linking together nodes, these nodes are elements such as images, text blocks, buttons, ordered lists, horizontal referrence and many others. These nodes are passed along with the CSS style sheets associated with them throughth render engine.

3. HTML, XML, XHTML—what sets them apart?
HTML, XML, XHTML are all markup languages.
- HTML (HTM), short for hypertext markup language, are the foundation and structure of web pages and can have style sheets or scripts embedded in them. They display document nodes. HTML is the most widely used web language, they standardize element and tagging systems and are used to render content and page layout.
- XML, short for Extensible Markup Language, it describes document nodes, it compliments HTML.It allows specific elements to update without refreshing thhe whole web page. It features the ability to store files in plain-text format to simply data sharing, ease of data transport and availability, and allows for upgrading without the loss of data.
- XHTML is short for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language, it bridges HTML and XML by combining the best of both with the goal of correcting some behaviors in HTML that causes problems with mobile devices. It is almost identical to HTML, its use ensures that a documented will be markedup correctly, and the code takes longer to write but is easier to maintian since its strict requirements make it less vulnerable to future changes.

5. What are the four essential elements every HTML page needs?

7. Review: What are the top naming practices for clean and organized code?
The top naming practices for organized code are:
- To use all lowercase letters, this works best with single word names ie.: About.html
- Camel casing in which the first word is lower case and all consecutive words are capitolized. ie.: galleryStylesheet.css
- Since you cannot use spaces in names, you can use either underscores or hyphens. ie.: two-dogs-sleeping.jpg or two_dogs_sleeping.jpg
