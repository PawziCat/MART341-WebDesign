<h3>Idea 1: Portfolio</h3>
    <p>As with any artist in this technology driven world, I will need to create an online portfolio. Online portfolios are a great way to present my work online in a professional manner that also gives pptential clients a idea of who I am and what kind of artist I am. It also provides a search footprint for myself as an artist, allowing people to more easily find my business.</p>

<h3>Idea 2: Official Streamer-Brand Website</h3>
    <p>This idea would allow me to help a friend grow as a content creator. THis will give him a higher chance of showing in searches and will allow him to gain more foot traffic on his twitch account. This also gives him a brand and image, something that people can recognize and engage with.</p>

<h3>Idea 3: Dog Training</h3>
    <p>This would be a great way to share something that I am passionate about with other people. I believe that every dog should receive basic training, this makes them better companions and gives them the necessary manners to interact with other people and animals. People often do not train their dogs due to being overwhelmed, frustrated or lack the money or resources to do so, this site sould provide free online training practices and tips.</p>
