    <p>The first idea that I have for a website is to create a portfolio of my media art that I have created. It would be a way to showcase my best work that would allow me to market myself and develop my web design skills. I would be aiming for a professional tone that still allows who I am as an artist and creator come through. Since I am color blind, most of my work features high contrast and lots of black and white graphics or illustrations.</p>

    <p>My second idea is to create an official streaming brand website for a friend that is a twitch streamer. I like to help support other content creators and small business. I would be aiming for a masculine and mature tone that includes elements related to the kinds of video games the streamer plays. Creating the website helps give them a online footprint and allows more people to find them through searches. I have already created their brand so I have the color scheme already determined.</p>

    <p>My third idea is to create a website about training dogs. This would be an educational site, that covers why training matters, basic training and tips for socialization. I would also like to include information about the various jobs that dogs perform. The site would have a fun and energetic tones, like blues and maybe yellow or orange accents for contrast. </p>
