 **Assignment 6** 
 
 1. In 2-3 sentences, explain which idea you've chosen to develop further and why. Feel free to expand on the tone or style you plan to use for the site (e.g., professional, playful, modern).
 
 I chose to create a website for a mock business I created called Pyrefect Pooch Dog Training. I chose this idea because I have a friend that has a dog training business and I want to surprise them with a website once I can better develop my skills as a web designer. I want the tone to be clean yet fun. I will be using blue, green and gray for the color theme and of course lots of dog pictures. The blue and green were chosen to contrast a little bit with the red coats of some of the dogs to create a more cohesive design

 2. In your README, continue briefly noting how you applied the balance concepts weâ€™ve discussed this week. How did adjusting width or background color help improve your layout? How did your final design compare to your initial idea? Did the balance and layout turn out as expected, or did you have to make adjustments along the way? If you experimented with float and margin, please tell me about your experience. Additionally, reflect on any challenges you faced during this assignment and how you overcame them. Did you encounter any issues with balancing content or using CSS? How did you solve them?

One of the concepts of balance that I applied to my website is asymmetry through the use of the rule of thirds. I really tried to vary the weight and the alignment of each elements to add visual interest. I chose a off white-gray color that complemented the greens and blues without causing them to be washed out ad to maintain the contrast for headings. I had to really experiment with getting things to align properly but was able to get a few elements exactly where I wanted them. Frustratingly enough, I was unable to work out how to use margins or padding, this caused the page to not look the way it was intended to.This was after I looked it up and tried everything I could think of from changing tag location to types of tags entirely. I wonder if this is a more of a CSS kind of thing.
