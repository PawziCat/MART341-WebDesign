 **Assignment 7** 

 **Prompt:**

 Return to the README.md file you created earlier. Share the aspect of your website you’re most proud of, and explain why. Focus on specific design choices, functionality, or features that stand out. Be sure to engage with this week’s discussion for additional insights and inspiration.

**Response**

 Aspects of my website that I am most proud of is the table that I made on the Program page. This took a lot of time and tweaking to get it to work the way that I wanted it to with the bullet points for my ordered list. I chose to use a table to organize my program page as it helped break the information on the page up into more managable chuncks. I would really like to figure out how to create collapsing table/menu instead of just a table. I feel this would further condense the information down into more manageble chunks as the visitor doesn't need nor want to scroll that far down a page, especially when there is very little point of interest on the page. I am still trying to figure out how to add images inside the table as well.
