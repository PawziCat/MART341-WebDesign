 **Assignment 8** 

### Div (at least 2):

I used divs to group my article content together for better organization.
I also used divs to group the audio player, video player and embedded map with the cooresponding description, credits sited, and ensuring proper alignment and structure.
I used divs to help set up my contact form.
### Span (at least 2):

I used a span to highlight the text on the articles, adding emphasis to specific parts of the link descriptions.
I used another span to emphasize information on the home page for the benefits of training.
I used spans on the table from the programs page.

### Audio (at least 1):

I embedded an audio file that provides a free resource to work with your dog on reactivity to other dogs barking. I allows the user to interact with controls to play, pause, and loop the audio.

### Video (at least 1):

I originally planned to use a video element for a hero video on the homepage, however, I ended up using a video that I got permission to use further down the page.

### Iframe (at least 1):

I used a iframe to embed a audio file on the home page.
I used an iframe to embed a video on the homepage.
I used an iframe to embed a map on the contact page.

### Class (at least 2):

I used the class nav to style the navigation links, and to keep the nav bar's formatting consistent on each page.
I used the class media-item to structure the layout of my audio clip to improve alignment and styling.

### Escape Character (at least 1):

I used the &copy; escape character to display the copyright symbol (Â©) in the footer of the webpage, providing a legal symbol without using a special character.


### Personal Notes:

I was unable to put in the accordon menu/table for my programs page. I intend to add this if this project is continued into the next week.
