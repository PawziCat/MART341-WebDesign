 **Assignment 9** 

## Materials and Setup:
* Dog Treats  

### Optional: 
* Treat pouch or baggie 
* Clicker 

## Instructions: 

### Steps 1:
Start the session by charging your praise word / clicker. Have your puppy perform basic commands like sit, laydown and touch for a couple minutes. Use your praise word / clicker and then treat them. 

### Steps 2:
Place treat on the ground and either cover it with your hand, for mouthier pups use your foot. Smaller breeds may learn this better with you crouching. 

### Steps 3:
At first do not say anything and wait for your puppy to stop going after the treat, praise them with an energetic yes / good or the clicker and give them a different treat from your pouch. Place the treat near the covered treat. 

### Steps 4:
Repeat till your puppy no longer is interested in the covered treat and begins to look at you for another treat.  

### Steps 5:
Start dropping the treat in front of you and covering it quickly. Once the pup looks at you every say yes / good pr use the clicker and feed the treat from your hand this time. Repeat process. 

### Steps 6:
Now dropping the treat without covering it unless your puppy starts to go after it. When they look to you praise then treat. 

### Steps 7:
Add the command "Leave it," the command should be said firmly a single time. Drop the treat and say "leave it" when the dog looks up at you immediately praise then treat. Repeat process. 

### Steps 8:
Start throwing the treat at the puppy's feet now and use the command leave it. If they leave it treat them with 2-3 treats one after the other. 

### Steps 9:
Finally repeat the process except drop multiple treats. Praise and treat from your hand, give multiple treats one at a time. Either drop more treats or pick them up and drop them again. 

## Additional Tips: 

* Using two different kinds of treats can help some dogs differentiate between the treats on the ground and the actual reward.

* Donâ€™t give them the treat you want them to leave, giving them this treat creates confusion about what you want. 

* To create a bomb proof leave it, practice in different places like the backyard, on walks, at parks and in pet friendly stores. 

* Leave it can be used for more than treats or dropped bits of food. It can be diversified to include other animals food, toys, other dogs, doorbells, knocks, ect. The command is a foundation in working on all kinds of reactivity from dogs, cars and people to door bells, barking and sirens.  


# Question for Instructor:

* Could not figure out how to get rid of the border box around form in contact page. I believe that I am missing something here.
