## Assignment 13

 
### 5 Techniques
#### Pages
I am working on my online portfolio for my graphic design business 
* Contact
* Gallery
* Branding
* About

#### Responsive Design:
Used flex, auto and percentages to control page layout instead of fixed numbers.

#### Media Queries:
Attempted to add media querries to help better control the responsiveness of my website.

#### Navigation Menu 
Adjusted navigagation menu to be responsive.

#### Dropdown Menu
I used the drop down menu to place my Branding page under my Gallery page.


#### Additional Notes:
I for the life of me cannot get the responsive design to work properly on both my Branding and Contact pages. I believe the Branding page is a conflicting or missing code for either my responsive css or my media queries. The map on the Contact Page however is not done through a syle sheet and I feel this is the entire reason for this page not being responsive.
