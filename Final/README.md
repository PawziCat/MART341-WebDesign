## Final

 
### 5 Techniques
#### Three or More Pages
I am working on my online portfolio for my graphic design business 
* Gallery
* Videos
* Branding
* About

#### A clear, well-organized layout with strong usability.
I used a grids, containers and sections to organize my layout. This was also used to create a responsive layout, unfortunately I could not for the life of me get my responsive coding to work properly on most of the pages, excluding the portfolio/gallery page. It is usable, but to my frustration is not entirely pretty. My video page is a disaster on mobile, the videos went completely off the side of the page.

#### Use of an external stylesheet.
* styles
* fonts
* menu
* responsive-design
* bootstrap.bundle
* gallery
* 
#### Apply at least one font.
I used the fonts retrolight and poppins.

#### At least one image (preferably your own or fair-use images).
I used my own artwork or placeholder images that I created.

#### At least one embedded media element (video, audio, Google Maps, etc.).
I embedded both videos and a google map.
#### Structural and semantic HTML markup with a clean and organized page layout.

#### Legible, well-commented, and error-free code
My code is well organized and noted so that other people could work on teh site if needed. There were no code errors.

#### Additional Notes:
I couldn't figure out where I needed to add or change code to make my carousel loop instead of becoming stuck after four images.
